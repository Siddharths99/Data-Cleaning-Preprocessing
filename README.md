# Data-Cleaning-Preprocessing
This project focused on cleaning and preparing the Titanic dataset for machine learning. I removed the Cabin column due to too many missing values, filled missing Age and Embarked entries, and converted categorical data using one-hot encoding. I visualized and removed outliers, then scaled the numerical features to get everything ready for modeling.
